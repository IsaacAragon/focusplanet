## Summary :notebook_with_decorative_cover:
Developed in **C#** with **WinForms**, **focusplanet** will be a free and open-source **time management app** for Windows. The app aims to help users organize their tasks, set objectives and write quick notes in a fast and easy way. The project is currently in the **planning** phase.

## Development :hammer_and_wrench:

### Features :gear:
Some **features planned** include:

#### Tasks management :clipboard:
**Create tasks**, organize them into **task lists**, add **due dates**, **repetitions**, **notes** and assign a **task priority**. Just like a good old to-do list. 

#### Set objectives :dart:
Add objectives and achieve your goals. When you select an objective, it will appear on the **main screen** with the number of **completed days** (streak system).

#### Write quick notes :memo:
Save **quick notes** in a sticky note style. Search notes by **tags**, change *background color* and more.
